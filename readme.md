## Ongoing Task List

- [x] 23/08/2022: Start using express.raw();
- [x] 24/08/2022: Implement restriction that users can only review (Create/Update/Delete) a tour that they have actually booked;
- [x] 24/08/2022: Implement nested booking routes: /tours/:id/bookings and /users/:id/bookings;
- [x] 29/08/2022: Improve tour dates: add a participants and a soldOut field to each date.
      A date then becomes like an instance of the tour.
      Then, when a user books, they need to select one of the dates.
      A new booking will increase the number of participants in the date, until it is booked out (participants > maxGroupSize).
      So, when a user wants to book, you need to check if tour on the selected date is still available;
- [x] Implement advanced authentication features:
      30/08/2022: confirm user email.
      06/09/2022: keep users logged in with refresh tokens.
      09/09/2022: two-factor authentication.
- [x] 09/09/2022: Implement a sign up form, similar to the login form;
- [x] 09/09/2022: Create verification endpoint to activate account;
- [x] 17/09/2022: On the tour detail page, if a user has taken a tour, allow them add a review directly on the website.
      Implement a form for this;
      17/09/2022: On the tour detail page, allow user to book for only not booked dates.
      17/09/2022: On the tour detail page, allow user to review already booked tours and update existing reviews.
      12/09/2022: Show new Tour date format. Show only the tour dates booked by the user.
- [x] Hide the entire booking section on the tour detail page if current user has already booked the tour
      (also prevent duplicate bookings on the model);
      17/09/2022: Booked tour benn presented by date.
- [ ] Implement ‚Äúlike tour‚Äù functionality, with favourite tour page;
- [ ] On the user account page, implement the ‚ÄúMy Reviews‚Äù page, where all reviews are displayed, and a user can edit them.
      (If you know React ‚öõ or Vue üß°, this would be an amazing way to use the Natours API and train your skills!);
- [ ] For administrators, implement all the ‚ÄúManage‚Äù pages, where they can CRUD (create, read, update, delete) tours,
      users, reviews, and bookings.
- [ ] Separate frontend and backend projects
- [ ] Start using docker for the app
- [ ] Automate deployment for the app
- [ ] Add unit and system test to the app
